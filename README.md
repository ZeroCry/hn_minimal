> A minimal Hacker News client written in [Preact], based on [Dan Bartlett](http://github.com/danbartlett)'s original client written in React.js.

This is a demonstration of how to optimize a React project by switching to [Preact].

The original React+jQuery app was **295kb**. Refactored to [Preact] + `fetch()`, it is now **5kb** _(~60x smaller, or around 1.5% of the original size)_.
